# Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange

This project demonstrates how the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm works.

The project uses 2 http servers to demonstrate how the algorithm works. These both need to be started to demonstrate the algorithm. The process is started by sending a GET request to
`http://localhost:3000/start`. The final secret key is printed out to the console for verification.
