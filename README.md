# Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange

This project demonstrates how the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm works.

There are 2 HTTP servers, Alice and Bob, that need be started. The algorithm is started by sending a GET request to
`http://localhost:3000/start`. The final secret key is printed out to the console for verification.
